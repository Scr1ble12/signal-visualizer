#  Signal Visualizer App

This is a real-time **Signal Visualizer App** that captures microphone input or plays a `.wav` audio file and visualizes:

-  Waveform (Amplitude vs Time)
-  Frequency Spectrum (via FFT)
-  Spectrogram (Frequency over Time)

Built with **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **Matplotlib**, this app showcases real-time signal processing in a visual and interactive way.
